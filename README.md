# WK4-FINAL-PROJECT
This is my Week 4 Final Project. Overall I am pleased with the result. Experimented a little. I used the code from a previous project (FES-LIBRARY) Since alot of the function were 
the same, hence the use of the word "books" in my Java and CSS. It saved me some time.
Had issues trying to convert my prices to millions of dollars. I found the solution on STack Overflow but could not get it to work in my JAva.
I was also not happy about my placement of the containers in the middle of my looped video.
